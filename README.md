## Usage

Upon launching the program, a window will emerge, presenting you with a range of distinctive categories:

- **My Library**: A comprehensive table cataloging all your manga entries, encompassing essential details such as the title, author, genre, and volume number. This section provides the versatility to explore and search for specific mangas, rectify erroneous information, and efficiently eliminate entries.

- **Add Manga**: This section offers a streamlined form to seamlessly introduce new manga entries. Essential information, including the title, author, genre, and volume number, can be entered effortlessly. A unique feature is the capacity to input volume numbers using a range-based notation (e.g., "1,3,5-8,12"), indicating ownership of volumes 1, 3, 5 through 8, and 12. This convenient notation simplifies the process of inputting shared specifications for multiple volumes

## Update note

- __Manga_Library1.1__ : _"volume number"_ can now accept a write like _"1,4-8,15"_, it's equal to _"1,4,5,6,7,8,15"_ and all these volume will be added to your list.
- __Manga_Library1.2__ : Display the mangas 10 by 10, otherwise the window expands until it exceeds the screen, making the tool unusable.
- __Manga_Library1.3__ : Fix a issue with search manga, add backup data feature and a icon.
- __Manga_Library1.4__ : Fix a issue with "modify a manga", design modifications, add a compressor "show more"/"show less" of the Library which able you to only see different manga's names, able to changes pages by scrolling, add more inputs check up.
- Reorganisation and rebuilding of the project
