# Manga Library Manager

This is a simple program that helps you manage your manga collection using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The user can add, delete and update manga features. The program stores manga information in a data file like in a database, which allows you to quickly search and sort your collection, and save your data between each execution.

## Usage

When you run the program, a window will appear with several categories :
- My library : A table with all your mangas (name, author, type, volume number, description, valuation, and the date when you add the manga), you can research a manga, modify information if something is wrong and delete a manga.
- Add manga : A form to add a new manga : name, author, type, description allow alphanumeric charactere only, valuation accept only float between 0 and 10, volume number accept a writing like "1,3,5-8,12" which means "i have volume 1 3 5 6 7 8 and 12" (so all of these have the same specifications).
- Statistics: Statistical analyses such as means and totals.

## Update note

- __Manga_Library1.1__ : _"volume number"_ can now accept a write like _"1,4-8,15"_, it's equal to _"1,4,5,6,7,8,15"_ and all these volume will be added to your list.
- __Manga_Library1.2__ : Display the mangas 10 by 10, otherwise the window expands until it exceeds the screen, making the tool unusable.
- __Manga_Library1.3__ : Fix a issue with search manga, add backup data feature and a icon.
