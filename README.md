# Manga Library Manager

Welcome to the Manga Manager, a user-friendly program designed to assist you in efficiently managing your manga collection through the intuitive Tkinter GUI toolkit. With this program, you can seamlessly add, delete, and update manga details, ensuring your collection remains organized and up-to-date. The application employs a structured data file system akin to a database, facilitating swift searches and convenient sorting of your collection. Furthermore, your data is preserved between each session, ensuring your progress is safeguarded and readily accessible.

## Usage

- **My Library**: A table cataloging all your manga entries, encompassing essential details such as the title, author, genre, and volume number(soon: possibility to add a icon). 
- **Searching** : You can search for manga using the search bar, which features a filter to assist you (e.g., "author:King" provides all books by the author King). 
- **Editing** : You can edit a book's information by double-clicking on its row, a window with book's information appear, do your changes.
- **Deleting** : delete a selection of manga by pressing 'Delete' or 'Backspace', A confirmation window appears to verify the action and prevent unintended deletions.
- **Sort** :  sort your table by clicking on a header, you can also reverse the sort by clicking again on the same header.
- **Add Book**: A window appears when you click on "Add Book," which will prompt you to enter a title, an author, a book genre, and a volume count (similar to Harry Potter Volume 2, for instance). This last parameter accepts a more convenient format for adding a large number of books at once (for example, "1-5,7-9,15,20" will be translated as "added volumes 1 to 5, 7 to 9, 15, and 20").
