My Manga Library

My first user interface with Tkinter, which allows managing your manga collection. 
You can add, delete, and modify each manga. 
There is also a statistics tab that allows you to see some interesting numbers about your manga library.

To use this program, you just need to download the latest version named 'Manga_LibraryX.X' and then launch 'main.exe' in the 'dist' folder."
