My Manga Library

My first user interface with Tkinter, which allows managing your manga collection. 
You can add, delete, and modify each manga. 
There is also a statistics tab that allows you to see some interesting numbers about your manga library.

To use this program, you just need to download the latest version named 'Manga_LibraryX.X' and then launch 'main.exe' in the 'dist' folder.

To download a folder from GitHub, navigate to your desired repository, select the folder you want to download from GitHub, copy the URL, then paste it at this URL : https://download-directory.github.io/

update note :
Manga_Library1.0 : First working version
Manga_Library1.1 : "volume number" accepted only number like "6","26",.. now, you can write "1,4-8,15", it's equal to 1,4,5,6,7,8,15 and all these volume will be added to your list.
