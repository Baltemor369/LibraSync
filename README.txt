Manga Library Manager

This is a simple program that helps you manage your manga collection using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The user can add, delete and update manga features. The program stores manga information in a data file like in a database, which allows you to quickly search and sort your collection, and save your data between each execution.

Installation :

Usage :

When you run the program, a window will appear with several categories :
- My library : A table with all your mangas (name, author, type, volume number, description, valuation, and the date when you add the manga), you can research a manga, modify information if something is wrong, delete a manga.
- Add manga : A form to add a new manga : name, author, type, description allow alphanumeric charactere only, valuation accept only float between 0 and 10, volume number accept a writing like "1,3,5-8,12" which means "i have volume 1 3 5 6 7 8 and 12" (so all of these have the same specifications).
- Statistics: Statistical analyses such as means and totals.

Update note :
Manga_Library1.1 : "volume number" accepted only number like "6","26",.. now, you can write "1,4-8,15", it's equal to 1,4,5,6,7,8,15 and all these volume will be added to your list.
